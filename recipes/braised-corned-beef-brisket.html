  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You have never had corned beef like this and if you try it, I truly believe you will never go back to the traditionally 'boiled' beef. This recipe was given to my mother-in-law during WWII by her Jewish boarding house owner and it has become a treasured family recipe. Unlike the commonly boiled corned beef, this is a slow braise that is tender, flavorful, and has a caramelized surface when it's done. I serve it with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips. It is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish dinner, but we love it so much that I cook it year around.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 pound flat-cut corned beef brisket</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon browning sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 sliced onion</li>
        <li>6 sliced garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 275 degrees F</li>
        <li>Discard any flavoring packet from corned beef. Brush brisket with browning sauce on both sides. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown brisket on both sides in the hot oil, 5 to 8 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Place brisket on a rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter onion and garlic slices over brisket and add water to roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.</li>

    </ol>
