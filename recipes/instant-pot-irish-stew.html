  <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm butter and oil in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) set to Saute function. Add lamb and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add onion and shallots to the pot; cook and stir until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute longer.</li>
        <li>Pour wine into the pot and scrape up any browned bits off the bottom of the pot. Cook until wine is reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Place carrots and potatoes on top of onions. Season with rosemary and thyme; stir to combine well. Arrange lamb over vegetables; pour beef broth on top.</li>
        <li>Close and lock the lid. Open vent for steaming. Select Meat/Stew function; set timer for 20 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.  </li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix water and potato starch until creamy.</li>
        <li>Unlock and remove lid. Switch to Saute function. Stir potato starch mixture into the stew; cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
